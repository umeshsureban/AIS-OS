# Sync canonical Claude skills (.claude/skills) into the Codex skill mirror (.agents/skills).
#
# Run this AFTER creating or editing any skill under .claude/skills/ so Codex sees the
# same content. .claude/skills is canonical. Codex reads .agents/skills (per
# references/tool-agnostic-setup.md), so the two must stay in sync. Pass one or more
# skill names to sync only those skills; omit arguments to sync everything.
#
# What it does: copies every canonical skill forward (overwrite) and applies the Codex
# path transform (.claude/skills -> .agents/skills) to markdown files only. Claude
# agent references stay under .claude/agents and scripts/binary assets copy verbatim.
#
# House rule: this script never deletes. If you RETIRE a skill (remove it from
# .claude/skills), it cannot exist in canonical anymore, so this script will WARN you to
# move the stale mirror copy to archives/ by hand (git mv), rather than deleting it.
